After working with language models daily for years, I've found that the difference between mediocre and excellent results often comes down to how you structure your prompts.

## The Problem with Basic Prompts

Most people type a quick question and hope for the best. That can work for simple tasks, but for anything complex, you're leaving quality on the table.

## Technique 1: Role Assignment

Tell the model who it should be. This frames the entire conversation.

**Basic:** "How do I improve my website's SEO?"

**Better:** "You are an SEO consultant with 10 years of experience. A small business owner asks you how to improve their local service website's SEO. Provide actionable advice."

## Technique 2: Chain of Thought

Ask the model to think step by step. This works especially well for reasoning tasks.

```
Solve this problem step by step:
[Your problem here]

First, identify what we know.
Then, determine what we need to find.
Finally, work through the solution.
```

## Technique 3: Few-Shot Examples

Show the model what you want by providing examples.

```
Convert these sentences to a professional tone:

Input: "Hey, can you send me that thing?"
Output: "Could you please send me the document we discussed?"

Input: "This is broken, fix it."
Output: [Model completes the pattern]
```

## Technique 4: Structured Output

Specify the exact format you need.

```
Analyze this code and respond in this format:

## Issues Found
- [List each issue]

## Suggested Fixes
- [Corresponding fixes]

## Code Quality Score
[1-10 rating with explanation]
```

## Technique 5: Constraints and Boundaries

Set clear limits to keep responses focused.

- "In 3 sentences or less..."
- "Using only built-in Python libraries..."
- "Suitable for a beginner audience..."

## Putting It Together

The best prompts combine multiple techniques. Start with a role, provide context, give examples if needed, specify the output format, and set appropriate constraints.

Experiment with these techniques and you'll see immediate improvements in your results.
