I needed app icons for a side project and decided to test how well AI image generators handle this specific use case. After generating 100 icons across different tools and prompts, here's what I learned.

## The Setup

I tested three generators:
- DALL-E 3
- Midjourney v6
- Stable Diffusion XL (local)

For each, I tried various prompting approaches to generate iOS-style app icons.

## What Worked

### Explicit Style References

Being specific about the style dramatically improved results.

**Vague:** "app icon for a weather app"

**Specific:** "iOS app icon, weather app, minimal design, single cloud symbol, gradient blue background, rounded corners, no text, professional, 1024x1024"

### Negative Prompts

Telling the model what NOT to include helped avoid common problems:
- "no text"
- "no borders within the icon"
- "no realistic photos"
- "no complex scenes"

### Color Constraints

Limiting the color palette produced more cohesive results. "Using only shades of blue and white" worked better than leaving colors open-ended.

## What Didn't Work

### Expecting Consistency

Getting multiple icons in a matching style was difficult. Each generation felt like starting fresh. For a full icon set, you'll need heavy post-processing.

### Text and Symbols

Any text in icons came out poorly. Even simple letters often had artifacts. Symbols fared better but still required careful prompting.

## The Results

Out of 100 generations:
- ~15 were usable with minor edits
- ~30 were good starting points for redesign
- ~55 needed significant work or were unusable

## My Recommendation

AI image generation is a helpful starting point for app icons, but not a replacement for a designer. Use it for ideation and rough concepts, then refine manually or hire a professional for the final assets.

The technology is improving rapidly though. I'll revisit this experiment in six months and see how things change.
