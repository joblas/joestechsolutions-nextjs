Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4 this week, and it's worth paying attention to. The new model brings meaningful improvements in areas that matter for practical work.

## Key Improvements

### Better Code Generation

The most noticeable improvement is in coding tasks. Claude Sonnet 4 produces cleaner, more idiomatic code and catches edge cases that previous versions missed. In my testing, it handled complex refactoring tasks with fewer errors.

### Improved Instruction Following

The model is noticeably better at following specific formatting instructions. When you ask for a particular output structure, you get it consistently. This makes it more reliable for automated workflows.

### Longer Context, Better Memory

Context window handling feels more robust. The model maintains coherence better across long conversations and documents.

## Performance and Pricing

Speed is comparable to the previous Sonnet version, which is good news. Pricing remains in the same tier, making it accessible for most use cases.

## Should You Switch?

If you're using Claude for coding or structured output tasks, the upgrade is worth it. The improvements are immediately noticeable in day-to-day work.

For general chat and simple queries, the difference is less dramatic. The previous version works fine for casual use.

## How to Access

Claude Sonnet 4 is available now through the API and claude.ai. No special access required—just update your API calls to use the new model version.

## My Take

This is a solid incremental improvement. Not a paradigm shift, but meaningful progress in areas that matter for practical work. Anthropic continues to focus on reliability and safety alongside capability improvements.
