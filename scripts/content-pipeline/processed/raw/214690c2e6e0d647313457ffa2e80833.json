Not making meaningful progress.\nYou work 10-hour days, clear your inbox, and say YES to every opportunity…\nYet, your income and skills are NOT where you want to be.\n99% of the time:\nIt’s because you’re drowning in Maintenance Mode. Busy Work.\nBut what if you could use AI to finally get clarity?\nTo identify the one thing that actually matters…\nToday, I’m giving you my CLARITY Prompt Chain. I used this exact prompt chain earlier in 2025 to realize I was spending 50% of my time on tasks that generated near 0% of my growth.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll have the objective truth about where your time should go.\nFor this to work best, AI needs to know who you are. If you haven’t yet, follow this tutorial to build your AI Second Brain.\nOnce that’s done, run the prompt chain below.\nLet’s dive in.\nWatch my Youtube for a more detailed tutorial:\nTo support my free AI education: HIT LIKE + LEAVE A COMMENT 🙏🙏\nPrompt 1 - Inventory\nThe 1st step is about removing your personal bias.\nWe often hallucinate our own productivity, thinking we do more high-value work than we actually do.\nThis prompt forces AI to reflect your reality back to you, so you can see your time-leaks in black and white.\nBased on everything you know about me, make an exhaustive bullet point list of everything I do.\nFeel free to drop in monthly calendar screenshots to give AI even more context about where your time goes!\nPrompt 2 - Priority\nNow that your activities are documented, we apply the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 rule).\nMost people make the mistake of asking AI for advice too early, which leads to generic answers.\nBy forcing AI to ask you clarifying questions and share its real-time Confidence Score, you ensure answers are based on your actual data, not hypotheticals.\nWhat are my top 3 activities that drive 80%+ of my results?\nAsk me clarifying questions, one at a time, until you're 95% confident in your answer. Always state your confidence score.\nPrompt 3 - Clarity\nThe final step, achieving Clarity, is all about radical and ruthless prioritization.\nKnowing your top 3 activities isn’t enough…\nExponential growth comes from extreme FOCUS.\nThis prompt helps you identify that ONE activity which makes all other tasks/goals 10x easier.\nThis prompt cuts through the noise, giving you a central focus.\nBased on everything we discussed, what's the 1 thing I should focus on?\nNext Steps\nThe next hard part is having the courage to ignore the other 999+ things on your list. Even though you know they’re lower-leverage, maybe you enjoy doing them or you’re competent in them, so it feels good doing them.\nIt’s really really hard, even for me, to stay focused. I’m far from perfect. But even small improvements, over a long time horizon, compound into big gains.\nSo, I recommend running this Clarity Prompt Chain once a quarter to ensure you haven’t drifted back into the “busy work” trap.\nGood luck with your 2026 New Years Resolution!\nP.S.
