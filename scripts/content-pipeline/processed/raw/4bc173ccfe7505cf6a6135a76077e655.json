There was public criticism of trade policy, warnings about AI bubbles popping, and a lot of talk about what comes next for the industry.\nWatch as TechCrunch’s Equity podcast discusses which conversations took over Davos this week, the latest startup raises that caught our eye, and more.\nSubscribe to Equity on YouTube, Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.
