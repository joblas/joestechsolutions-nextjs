    question: "What AI models can I run?",
    answer: "You get access to the latest open-source models including Qwen3, Gemma3, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama — many of which rival GPT-4 in quality. We select the optimal model for your hardware and use case during setup, and you can switch or add models anytime."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any technical knowledge?",
    answer: "None at all. We handle the entire installation, configuration, and model selection. You get a clean, ChatGPT-style interface — just open your browser and start chatting. If you can use a web browser, you can use your private AI."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Local, Cloud, and Managed?",
    answer: "Local runs entirely on your computer — free forever after the one-time setup. Cloud gives you a dedicated server accessible from anywhere with automatic backups, HTTPS, and a custom domain. Managed adds workflow automation, document Q&A, private web search, and hands-on strategy support."
  },
  {
    question: "What hardware do I need for a local install?",
    answer: "Minimum 8GB RAM to run smaller models like Qwen3 4B. We recommend 16GB for the best experience with models like Qwen3 8B or Gemma3 12B. We auto-detect your hardware and pick the optimal model — no guesswork required."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data really private?",
    answer: "Yes, 100%. Everything runs on your hardware or your dedicated server. No data ever touches OpenAI, Google, or any third-party servers. No telemetry, no usage tracking, no model training on your conversations. Your data is yours — period."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you support?",
    answer: "We offer tailored starter kits for 9 industries: Healthcare (HIPAA-aware), Legal (attorney-privilege safe), Financial, Therapy, Education (FERPA-safe), Real Estate, Construction, Creative, and Small Business. Each kit includes industry-specific prompts, model recommendations, and compliance guidance."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the Managed tier?",
    answer: "Everything in Cloud, plus n8n workflow automation, document Q&A with RAG (upload your business docs and ask questions), private web search via SearXNG, 3 custom AI workflows built for your business, quarterly strategy calls, and priority same-day support."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer: "Yes. No contracts, no commitments. Cloud and Managed subscriptions can be cancelled any month. Local installs are yours forever — one payment, done. We believe the service should keep you, not the contract."
