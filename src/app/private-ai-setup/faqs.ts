    question: "What VPS specs do I get?",
    answer: "Hostinger KVM 1: 1 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 50GB NVMe SSD. I've found this handles 7B parameter models (Mistral 7B, Llama3 8B) really well for most use cases. If you need to run larger models down the road, we can always upgrade — I'll help you scale when you're ready."
  },
  {
    question: "What hardware do I need for local install?",
    answer: "8GB RAM minimum, though I recommend 16GB for a smoother experience. Any modern CPU from 2020 or later works great. GPU isn't required, but if you have one, I'll configure it for faster responses. During our call, I'll check your specs and make sure you're set up for success."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel VPS hosting anytime?",
    answer: "Absolutely — no contracts, no penalties. Cancel anytime through Hostinger. Your $29/mo covers the VPS, domain, and my ongoing support. I want this to work for you, and if it's ever not the right fit, you're free to go."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data really private?",
    answer: "Yes, and this is the whole point. With local install, everything runs on your machine — your prompts, outputs, and data never leave your computer. With VPS, you get your own dedicated server — no shared resources, no third-party access. You own the hardware and data completely. I set this up for clients specifically because they want that control back."
  },
  {
    question: "What open-source models can I run?",
    answer: "Mistral 7B, Llama3 8B, CodeLlama, Phi-2, and many more. During our call, I'll ask about what you want to use AI for, then recommend the best model for your specific needs. Most clients start with Mistral or Llama and we can always add more later."
