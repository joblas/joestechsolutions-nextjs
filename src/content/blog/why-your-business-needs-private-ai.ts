<p class="lead">Let me paint you a picture. It's Tuesday morning. Your paralegal is drafting a motion and hits a wall with the language. She opens ChatGPT, pastes in the client's full case summary — names, incident details, legal strategy — asks for help polishing it, and gets a clean paragraph back in 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Problem solved, right?</p>

<p>Not quite. That client data just left your office. It went through OpenAI's servers, potentially got used to improve their models (depending on your account settings), and now lives somewhere you have zero visibility into. Your client never consented to that. Neither did your ethics board.</p>

<h2>The Problem Nobody Talks About</h2>

<p>AI tools like ChatGPT have become so frictionless that people use them without thinking about where the data goes. And why would they? The interface is a simple text box. There's no scary prompt asking "Are you sure you want to send this confidential information to a third-party server?"</p>

<p>But that's exactly what's happening every time someone uses a cloud-based AI tool with real business data.</p>

<p>OpenAI, Google, Anthropic — these are real companies with real servers, real employees, and real legal obligations in multiple jurisdictions. When your data hits their APIs, it's subject to their privacy policies, their security posture, and their decisions about data retention. You're not in control of any of that.</p>

<p>For a lot of businesses, this is a compliance time bomb.</p>

<h2>Who's Most at Risk</h2>

<p>Not every business has the same exposure, but some industries need to be paying very close attention:</p>

<h3>Law Firms</h3>
<p>Attorney-client privilege exists for a reason. The moment client information leaves your systems and hits a third-party server — even with a zero-data-retention agreement — you've introduced risk. Bar associations are starting to issue guidance on this. If you're doing any AI-assisted drafting with real case details, you need to know where that data goes.</p>

<h3>Healthcare Providers</h3>
<p>HIPAA doesn't care that the AI gave you a good answer. If Protected Health Information went through an API that isn't covered under a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA), you may have a reportable breach. OpenAI does offer a HIPAA-compliant tier with a BAA, but it costs significantly more and most small practices aren't set up on it. Most are just using the standard ChatGPT Team plan and hoping for the best.</p>

<h3>Financial Advisors and Wealth Managers</h3>
<p>Client account details, portfolio strategies, estate plans — this is the exact kind of sensitive financial information that regulators take seriously. SEC and FINRA both have data governance expectations. Using commercial AI tools with client data without proper controls isn't just a bad look; it's a potential violation.</p>

<p>Even outside these industries, there's a simple principle at play: your client data is your responsibility. If you wouldn't email it to a stranger, you shouldn't paste it into a text box that sends it to someone else's servers.</p>

<h2>The Solution: Run AI on Your Own Hardware</h2>

<p>Here's the good news: you don't need to give up AI to protect your data. You just need to run it in-house.</p>

<p>The open-source AI ecosystem has matured significantly in the last couple of years. Tools like <strong>Ollama</strong> and <strong>Open WebUI</strong> make it genuinely straightforward to run capable large language models on your own hardware. We're talking about models that are competitive with GPT-4 for most business tasks — summarizing documents, drafting emails, answering questions about your processes, analyzing data.</p>

<p>The difference is the data never leaves your machine.</p>

<h3>How It Actually Works</h3>

<p>Ollama is a tool that runs AI models locally. You install it, pull a model, and it runs as a local server on your hardware. No internet connection required once the model is downloaded. No API keys going to external services. No usage data being sent anywhere.</p>

<p>Open WebUI is the interface layer — it gives you a polished, ChatGPT-style chat interface that connects to your local Ollama instance. Your team gets a familiar tool that feels like what they're used to, but everything stays on your network.</p>

<p>The install process is genuinely simple. Once the hardware is configured and connected, it's roughly:</p>

<pre><code>curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3.1
</code></pre>

<p>Then install Open WebUI via Docker, point it at your Ollama instance, and you're running. Your team connects to it on your local network (or through a VPN if you have remote workers), and they get an AI assistant that can handle their daily tasks without any data leaving the building.</p>

<p>Models like Llama 3.1, Mistral, and Qwen are capable enough for the vast majority of business writing, summarization, Q&A, and drafting tasks. For most day-to-day usage, your team won't notice a meaningful difference compared to ChatGPT.</p>

<h2>The Cost Comparison That Makes This a No-Brainer</h2>

<p>Here's where the business case gets really clear.</p>

<p>ChatGPT Team is $25 per seat per month. For a 10-person firm, that's <strong>$3,000 per year</strong>. Ongoing. Every year. And you still don't own your data.</p>

<p>A private AI setup — proper hardware, configured and ready to go — runs around <strong>$199 one-time</strong> for the setup service, plus the cost of hardware (which you already own or can purchase once). No monthly fees. No per-seat licensing. No renewal conversations.</p>

<p>The hardware pays for itself fast. A solid mini PC or repurposed workstation runs $300–800 and handles most business AI workloads without breaking a sweat. Add the setup cost and you're looking at under $1,000 total — less than a third of what you'd spend on ChatGPT in a single year.</p>

<p>Year two? Just electricity.</p>

<h2>What Private AI Can (and Can't) Do</h2>

<p>Let's be straight about limitations. A locally-run model won't have real-time internet access. It won't know what happened in the news today. And for highly specialized tasks — complex code generation, cutting-edge research — frontier models like GPT-4o still have an edge.</p>

<p>But for the bread-and-butter business tasks your team does every day? Drafting correspondence, summarizing meeting notes, answering questions about your internal policies, reviewing contracts for key clauses, generating first drafts of reports — a well-configured private AI handles all of this well.</p>

<p>And it does it without you wondering what's happening to your data.</p>

<h2>The Setup Process</h2>

<p>What I do at Joe's Tech Solutions is take care of the full configuration — hardware selection guidance, Ollama install, model selection for your use case, Open WebUI setup, network configuration so your team can access it securely, and a walkthrough so everyone knows how to use it.</p>

<p>You end up with a working system that your team can use immediately. No ongoing technical management required on your end. The system runs itself.</p>

<p>If you want to add new models later, it's one command. If you want to connect it to your document storage or build automations around it, that's doable too — but you don't need any of that to get started.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Using commercial AI tools with sensitive client data is a risk that most businesses haven't consciously decided to take — they've just defaulted into it because the tools are convenient. That's worth correcting.</p>

<p>Private AI isn't just for big enterprises with security teams. A small firm with 5 people can run it on a single mini PC sitting under a desk. The technology is accessible, the setup is straightforward (with the right help), and the cost is a fraction of what you're probably spending or considering spending on commercial tools.</p>

<p>If you work with data that matters — your clients', your business's, your team's — it's worth 15 minutes to think seriously about where that data goes when you use AI tools. And if the answer concerns you, there's a real, practical alternative.</p>
