# Ralph Progress Log - AI Blog UI

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Next.js 14+ project with App Router
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling
- Content lives in /content/blog/guides/ and /content/blog/articles/ as MDX files
- Components go in /src/components/blog/
- Lib functions go in /src/lib/blog/
- The content pipeline (Python) is already complete in /scripts/content-pipeline/
- Use `pnpm build` for type checking (no separate typecheck script)
- The ralph folder is excluded from TypeScript build (separate project)

## Project Context
- Building a blog UI for an automated AI education content platform
- Two content types: Guides (evergreen how-tos) and Articles (timely news)
- Five pillars: local-ai, prompting, tutorials, news, experiments
- Design inspired by artificial-intelligence.blog and forwardfuture.ai
- Must support dark mode and be fully responsive

- Blog content model and types already implemented (found pre-existing)
- Files verified: src/lib/blog/types.ts, src/lib/blog/pillars.ts
- Fixed tsconfig.json to exclude ralph folder from TypeScript compilation
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The ralph folder contains a separate project (flowchart app) that should not be included in main build
  - No `pnpm typecheck` script exists - use `pnpm build` which includes TypeScript checking
  - Types include: Post, PostMeta, PostFrontmatter, Pillar, ContentType, PillarSlug
  - Pillars have Tailwind classes for both light and dark mode styling

- Created MDX content loader at src/lib/blog/posts.ts
- Added gray-matter dependency for frontmatter parsing
- Implemented functions: getAllPosts(), getPostBySlug(), getPostsByType(), getPostsByPillar()
- Also added: getAllPostsMeta(), getFeaturedPosts(), getAllTags(), getPostsByTag()
- Files changed: src/lib/blog/posts.ts, package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gray-matter is the standard for parsing MDX frontmatter
  - Content is in content/blog/guides/ and content/blog/articles/
  - Reading time calculated at 200 words per minute
  - Slugs extracted from filename (date prefix removed if present)

- Created 4 sample MDX content files for testing blog UI
- Files created:
  - content/blog/guides/getting-started-with-ollama.mdx (pillar: local-ai, featured: true)
  - content/blog/guides/effective-prompting-techniques.mdx (pillar: prompting)
  - content/blog/articles/claude-sonnet-4-release.mdx (pillar: news)
  - content/blog/articles/ai-image-generation-experiment.mdx (pillar: experiments)
- All files have complete frontmatter matching the schema
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Frontmatter requires: title, date, type, pillar, excerpt; optional: featured, featuredImage, tags, author, draft
  - Date format is ISO string: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  - Featured images referenced with /images/blog/ path (images don't need to exist yet)

  - Created PostCard.tsx component in src/components/blog/
  - Displays: title, date, pillar tag (color-coded), content type badge
  - Links to /blog/[slug] correctly
  - Responsive width with rounded border and hover effects
  - Uses cn() utility for className merging
  - Files changed: src/components/blog/PostCard.tsx
  - **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PostCard uses getPillarBySlug to get pillar colors (bgClass, textClass, darkBgClass, darkTextClass)
  - Uses line-clamp-2 for title truncation
  - Uses group/group-hover pattern for linked hover states
  - Date formatted with toLocaleDateString for consistent display

- Created PostGrid.tsx component in src/components/blog/
- Responsive grid: 1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet (sm:), 4 columns desktop (lg:)
- Consistent gap-6 spacing
- Empty state displays "No posts found." message
- Files changed: src/components/blog/PostGrid.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Grid uses Tailwind responsive prefixes: grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4
  - Component accepts className prop for additional styling via cn() utility
  - PostCard used as child component within the grid
