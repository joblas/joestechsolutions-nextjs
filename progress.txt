# Ralph Progress Log - AI Blog UI

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Next.js 14+ project with App Router
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling
- Content lives in /content/blog/guides/ and /content/blog/articles/ as MDX files
- Components go in /src/components/blog/
- Lib functions go in /src/lib/blog/
- The content pipeline (Python) is already complete in /scripts/content-pipeline/
- Use `pnpm build` for type checking (no separate typecheck script)
- The ralph folder is excluded from TypeScript build (separate project)

## Project Context
- Building a blog UI for an automated AI education content platform
- Two content types: Guides (evergreen how-tos) and Articles (timely news)
- Five pillars: local-ai, prompting, tutorials, news, experiments
- Design inspired by artificial-intelligence.blog and forwardfuture.ai
- Must support dark mode and be fully responsive

- Blog content model and types already implemented (found pre-existing)
- Files verified: src/lib/blog/types.ts, src/lib/blog/pillars.ts
- Fixed tsconfig.json to exclude ralph folder from TypeScript compilation
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The ralph folder contains a separate project (flowchart app) that should not be included in main build
  - No `pnpm typecheck` script exists - use `pnpm build` which includes TypeScript checking
  - Types include: Post, PostMeta, PostFrontmatter, Pillar, ContentType, PillarSlug
  - Pillars have Tailwind classes for both light and dark mode styling
